## ðŸ“– Abstract
Efficient video analytics is crucial for smart cities, traffic monitoring, and intelligent transportation systems.  
This work introduces a **dynamic bitrate optimization framework** that fine-tunes video compression parameters â€”  
Frame Rate (FPS), Resolution, Quantization Parameter (QP), Entropy Coding, Motion Estimation, and Macroblock Partitioning â€”  
to balance **video quality, computational complexity, and bandwidth efficiency** in resource-constrained environments.
